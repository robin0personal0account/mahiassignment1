    </header>

    <section>
        <h2>1. Definition of Microeconomics</h2>
        <p>Microeconomics is a field of economics that focuses on the behavior of individuals, households, and businesses as they make decisions within the economy.</p>
        <p>It contrasts with macroeconomics by zeroing in on smaller individual components.</p>
        <p>It examines how choices and incentives influence the allocation and use of resources at a personal or business level.</p>
        <p>Microeconomics explains why different goods and services hold varying values and how businesses and individuals engage in efficient production and trade, collaborating for mutual benefit.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2. Scope of Microeconomics</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Factor Markets:</strong> Studies how labor, capital, and other inputs are allocated and priced, including wage determination and capital markets.</li>
            <li><strong>Welfare Economics:</strong> Evaluates how economic policies and market outcomes affect social welfare, focusing on resource and income distribution.</li>
            <li><strong>Market Failures and Government Intervention:</strong> Examines cases where markets fail, such as externalities and public goods, and the role of government intervention.</li>
            <li><strong>Behavioral Economics:</strong> Analyzes how psychological factors influence economic decision-making, deviating from traditional rational models.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3. Limitations of Microeconomics</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Unrealistic Assumptions:</strong> Assumes "ceteris paribus," meaning all other factors remain constant, which rarely happens in practice.</li>
            <li><strong>Static Analysis:</strong> Uses static analysis that may not apply to real-world dynamic scenarios.</li>
            <li><strong>Full Employment Assumption:</strong> Often assumes full employment, which is not realistic in all contexts.</li>
            <li><strong>Laissez-Faire Policy Assumption:</strong> Assumes minimal government intervention, but real-world governments are usually involved in economic regulation.</li>
            <li><strong>Neglect of Macroeconomic Factors:</strong> Focuses narrowly on specific segments of the economy and overlooks the larger macroeconomic picture.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>4. Economic Goods vs Free Goods</h2>
        <p>Economic goods are limited in supply and require human effort, while free goods, like air, are abundant and available without effort.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Economic Goods:</strong> Limited, involve opportunity costs, and are exchanged in markets.</li>
            <li><strong>Free Goods:</strong> Abundant, do not involve opportunity costs, and are naturally available without the need for human effort.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>5. Production Possibility Curve (PPC)</h2>
        <p>The Production Possibility Curve (PPC) illustrates the trade-offs between producing two goods using limited resources. It shows the maximum potential output for each good.</p>
        <p>The curve demonstrates opportunity costs, as increasing the production of one good requires sacrificing the production of another.</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>At point B: 20,000 oranges and 120,000 apples.</li>
            <li>At point C: 45,000 oranges and 85,000 apples.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The curve is outward-bending, reflecting the trade-offs involved. The highest point on the curve represents production of one good and none of the other.</p>
